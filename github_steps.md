# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

Initialize git in your local repository
add file to staging area
commit file
connect local repository to remote github using SSH key
make more changes
add to staging area
commit to changes
push up your changes

When we make more changes we need to update the remote version to have remote access to those changes
